						<h1>PROJECTS</h1>

						<p>The work below details the main areas I have strong skills in. During my career I have worked on a variety of projects, including designing and coding emails, writing articles for <a href="http://blog.stoneshot.com/author/alice-williams/" target="_blank">StoneShot's blog</a> and designing magazines, brochures and other key marketing materials. If there is something you'd like to know more on please feel free to contact me.</p>

								</a>
						</div>

						<p>I work closely with the Marketing Manager on projects such as the Digital Marketing Survey and UX/UI design for our marketing platform.</p>
						<p>The Digital Marketing Survey involves a range of tasks, including designing and coding the email campaigns, coding the survey forms using ASP and JavaScript, post-survey analysis and designing the results brochures. </p>
						<p>Other marketing collateral includes sales aids, email campaigns for prospects clients and folders.</p>

						<p>In the past year I have greatly increased my knowledge in email marketing; not only do I amend and code emails for clients, I also create bespoke, responsive designs.</p>
						<p>This is something I am passionate about and enjoy keeping up-to-date with the latest trends to ensure that all designs work across every email client and device.</p>
						<p>Please get in touch if you'd like to see more examples of my work within email marketing.</p>

						</div>

						<h3>Magazine design</h3>

						<p>Whilst working with copywriters and the public relations team, I put together the company magazines, Prospects in Partnership and Prospects. This included the complete design, sourcing images or creating illustrations, as well as overseeing the print using local suppliers.</p>
						<p>You can view the whole range <a href="http://www.prospects.co.uk/AboutUs/ProspectsinPartnership.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>; I was responsible for issues 19 to 22 and Yorkshire and Humber, Issue 1.</p>

									<img src="imgs/bkgrd2.jpg">
								</a>
						</div>

						<p>Producing corporate collateral for all parts of the business was a key responsiblity for me at Prospects. I was able to work on a variety of print material such as brochures, flyers, postcards and posters. I also looked after merchandising and arranged design and printing for stationary, pull up banners and event materials. </p>
						<p>Working with such corporate branding allowed me to understand the importance of a company's brand and ensuring that all material came as part of a package.</p>
